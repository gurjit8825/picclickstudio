**Financial Risk:**

**Copyright issues with photography business:**

There are copyright laws and whether or not we should sign over rights to our clients. If we choose to sign them over, we may risk losing income because our clients can use those images to make copies instead of ordering prints from us. Or, if you don’t sign over rights and someoneuses our photographs by copying them, it will be expensive legal process for those unauthorized use of our photographs.

**Property Damage:**

In this business, our photographers who will work on-site in residential or commercial spaces, one of the biggest issues is property damage. In the Real Estate Photographers, several thousand dollars’ worth of damage could happen simply by resting gear on an unfinished lighting fixture attached to a wall.

**Variable Income**

It will be challenge for us because our event photographers will likely have more business during the summer, when graduations and weddings are more frequent and our artistic photographers will have more income based on the schedule of art galleries and showings. The seasonal nature of this business can lead to problems with cash flow during slow periods of work.

**Technology Risk:**

Equipment damage: we may face equipment risks such as our lighting equipment breakage just before a photo shoot. These risks pose a significant loss in performance and income until the repairs have been completed. The lenses of cameras are very sensitive that require extra care which could be damage with some negligence with these.

Data may lose: there are number of technical problems which may occur due to the faulty memory chips. Data in some storage places may corrupt owing to the unwanted viruses.

**Market risk:**

Mobile Phone camera: One of the most common risk in photography is the improvement in high resolution of mobile phone cameras which deteriorate the interest of customer to hire a photographer for capturing their events. They tend to prefer their mobile phone cameras with high quality images which will be risk for photography business.

**Team risk:**

Controversy: nowadays controversy has become a common issue or risk for the popularity of this business. A photographer's reputation can be ruined due to questionable work or behaviour. Sometimes a lack of common sense or appropriate behaviour could bring down the image of photographers in market and may create some teams misunderstanding.

**Solutions:**

We have some Solutions in order to reduce these risks. We will not like to accept these risks in our business because these risks could be obstacle for the growth of our project. every problem has some solutions that could increase the possibility of success.

**For copyright issue**: it would be best to opt for laws which are most favourable for us and customers. we will take help from some legal adviser to git rid from such copyright issue because they could help us in finding solution if any problem will occur.

**For property damage:** Luckily the photographer's liability insurance cover the damage in full.Property insurance will be easiest way to cover the cost of any kind of damage. It will help in fixing damage by paying its original costs.

**For fluctuating income:** one of the best solutions is to fix it by giving offers when season is off. So, the customer will attract and it will be better from earning something instead of nothing.fixed costs are also the solution for this so that customers could feel comfortable with the selection of particular event oriented photography.

**For broken equipment**: it would be better to insure all the costly equipment’s and there are number of branded equipment’s are available in the market that comes with guaranties and warranties. It would be best to by branded equipment’s rather than other. Dust is main cause of damage in lenses so it would be better to have proper care of these. there are some special kind of brushes.

**For increased demand of mobile phones:** it would be better to increase the resolution of cameras lenses at a high pace so that mobile phone cameras features could not relates with each other. And customer could be more satisfy with the clarity of picture captured with cameras not with mobile phones. 

**For controversy**: there should be some ethical rule for the employees and rules should be mandatary to follow so that there should be less chances of discriminations and controversy among customers and employees. both have to follow their limits in order to achieve fame and popularity
